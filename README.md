# 1ST-PYTHON-PROJECT
Rock Paper Scissors Game (Python)

This project is a simple command-line Rock Paper Scissors game where the user plays against the computer. The program uses Python’s random module to generate the computer’s move, compares it with the user’s input, and displays the result. It also allows the user to play multiple rounds until they choose to exit.

#Overview:

The game follows the classic rules:

Rock beats Scissors

Scissors beat Paper

Paper beats Rock

Each round, the user enters their choice, and the computer randomly picks one of the three options. The program checks both choices and prints whether the user won, lost, or tied.

#How It Works:

1. The game prints a short introduction.


2. It waits for the user to enter a move (rock, paper, or scissors).


3. The computer picks a random move from a predefined list.


4. The program compares both choices and determines the winner.


5. After each round, the user can choose to play again or quit.



#How to Run the Game:

1. Install Python 3 on your computer if it isn’t already installed.


2. Save the program in a file (for example: rps.py).


3. Open your terminal or command prompt.


4. Navigate to the folder where the file is saved.


5. Run the game using:

python rps.py
